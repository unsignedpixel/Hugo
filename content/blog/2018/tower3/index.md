In 2016, the nice folks from fournova.com send me [some goodies]({{<ref "tower.md"\>}}). Two years later, I evaluate the beta of Tower 3, tweet about it and they were going to send me another T-Shirt. :-)

But since I'd rather like to see the [Developer Manifesto][2] on the wall of my day job office (helping to spread the word), they send me that along with warm words and some stickers. I hate to repeat myself here, but I really appreciate their generous and customer facing attitude. Hopefully, Tower 3 is going to be a huge success (try it out while it is still in [beta](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/tower-public-beta-2018-whats-new/)!) and perhaps I can look forward to 2020 to win my biennial goodies from [Fournova](http://fournova.com) ;-)

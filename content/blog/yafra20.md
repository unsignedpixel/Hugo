![Yafra 2.0](/images/yafra2.png)

My intention with the SwiftUI port of Yafra was to release it as soon as the bare functionality was there and then polish it (and there is a lot to polish when using SwiftUI). The release coud have been 8 weeks ago. But there was still this one edge case test for the model layer that had to be written. And at the same time it is more fun to tweak the UI or even add new features. Like a map view for the exposure locations. Although that required to wrap `MapKit` for SwiftUI because `Map` does not provide clustering. And so I got sidetracked and week after week went by without getting closer to an actual release. But today, I finally submitted 2.0 to the App Store. :-)

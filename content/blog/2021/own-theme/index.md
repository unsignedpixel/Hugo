**unsignedpixel.com** is now based on my own [hugo](gohugo.io) theme!
<!-- more --> 
As mentioned in [new theme]({{< ref "new_theme.md" >}}) earlier this year,
I wanted a theme for this site that satisfies at least these requirements
* no Javascript
* no tracking/external dependencies (like google or font delivery via CDN)
* (nice typography)

Typing `hugo new theme` is easy. Actually filling the created template with code requires HTML and CSS skills. Some basic understanding of how Hugo works is required as well. There are still a lot of things on the todo list, but it is always better to release early and often than to polish the code to death.

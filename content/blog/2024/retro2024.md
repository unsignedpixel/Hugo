2024 was yet another very busy year for me and there was no time for any programming side projects.		
<!-- more --> 
Like mentioned in [last years retro]({{< ref "retro2023.md" >}}), we had an old house in the country side refurbished. It meant devoting a lot of time and energy. We moved to the house this summer and are still busy finishing up the remaining work. I would really like to pick up work on yafra and finally publish yafra tagger, but can't make any promises.

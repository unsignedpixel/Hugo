2023 was a busy year. I joined a different team at work, looked after some major construction/remodelling work for an old house we bought and lots of other stuff                                          ...

Last years [2022 retro]({{< ref "retro2022.md">}}) stated that personal projects had to take a back seat and the same holds true this year. Before joining a different team at work early in 2023, I was making good progress with [Yafra Tagger]({{< ref "yafra-tagger.md">}}).

Then my new day job came with some new skills to learn. Before, I had been developing applications that were only used internally. But now, the applications serve a mobile app and a public web site. And regulation adds strict security requirements for the safety of our customers data. In other words, the new job consumed more of the energy that I  would otherwise spent on my side projects.

But the main reason is an old house in the country side. We bought it 2 years ago and had it refurbished. Most of the actual work took place this year and there were times when I spent several hours a day discussing details with the different companies doing the actual work. As a result that 'side project' consumed any remaining time. But now that the majority of the work is done, I look forward to pick up the work on Yafra in 2024 ðŸ˜€

For good reasons, none of my iOS projects were finished this year. 
After moving to Hamburg this summer, some change requests for a long running project in my day job consumed way more time than expected, leaving no room for any work in the evening. <!--more--> 

And moving to the highest ranking town in the world for a night out, at least according to this [survey][1], doesnâ€™t help either. 

Developing iOS apps was always intended to do more interesting work than my day job provided and to keep up to date with current technologies. 2018 should bring some challenges at work, so this site will probably remain dormant most of the time.

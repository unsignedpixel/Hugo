WWDC 2022 went by and I hardly noticed. Not that I am not interested in developing for iOS anymore, quite the opposite is true! But in my hometown, some 700km from where I live now, there was an exposition of my fathers work as an artist and I used the opportunity to visit the vernissage rather than decide which dub dub videos would be most interesting for me.

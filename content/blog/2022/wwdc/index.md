WWDC 2022 went by and I hardly noticed. Not that I am not interested in developing for iOS, quite the opposite is true! But in my hometown, some 700km from where I live now, there was an exposition of my fathers work as an artist and I used the opportunity to visit the [vernissage](https://www.zweibruecken.de/de/kultur-tourismus/kultur-erleben/kulturelle-einrichtungen/stadtmuseum/sonderausstellungen/) rather than decide which dub dub videos would be most interesting for me.

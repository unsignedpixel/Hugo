As mentioned in the last [last]({{< ref "connected" >}}) post, I worked my way towards getting [Yafra](https://unsignedpixel.com/yafra) submitted to the App Store for review.

 But using the date of the initial upload to the Apple App Store as the birth date for the account probably wasn't a good idea. The account got locked right away because you have to be at least 13 years old to open an account with Twitter <br>¯\\_(ツ)_/

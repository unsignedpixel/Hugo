What (an emotional) rollercoaster ride.
<!--more-->

After feeling confident about the [new app]({{<ref "mynewtoy.md">}}) and it's UI, I had to face the fact that not all of my testers found it quite as easy to use as I thought it would be. On the other hand, I made a lot of progress learning UIKit. As a result, improving the existing code wasn't as time consuming as it used to be two weeks ago. So some progress there plus the (still) exciting feeling of releasing code for beta test to the App Store :-) But there is the well founded criticism on the usability and on-boarding experience. As the title for this post suggeests, it is quite a roller coaster ride, but I enjoy it!

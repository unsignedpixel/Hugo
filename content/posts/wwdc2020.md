I allocated some time to watch session videos from WWDC 2020. Many topics sounded tempting, but I skipped them in favor of stuff that could support my side project.
Yafra should have received some pending features, but I was scared to increase complexity to a point were I'd be adding bugs instead of features.

A graph explaining the situation can be found starting around 24:10 in this [WWDC SwiftUI Video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10119/). So over the next weeks, I will focus on SwiftUI and attempt a rewrite of Yafra to take advantage of a simplified data flow in a SwiftUI app. That should enable more features like map view and maybe even iCloud support.

After spending far too much time polishing [my new toy]({{< ref "mynewtoy" >}}), I finally signed up for a paid developer account to get it out in the wild. That should have been the easy part. 

<!--more-->
But it was not. I didn't want to use my personal Apple ID for the developer account and tried to set up a new one with a new email account. For some reason, Apple would not accept that email. Now what? Use yet another email that was accepted and then change that back to the intended one. What a strange obstacle â€¦

But finally, I am connected (to the iTunes store) Now I try to wrap my head around App IDs, bundle indentifiers, certificates and so on. Taking small steps, I should be able to upload the app for review real soon.

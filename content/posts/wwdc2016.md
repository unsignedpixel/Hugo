I couldn't watch all of the WWDC 2016 keynote and caught only the last bits of macOS Sierra and some iMessage stuff. The latter I couldn't really make sense of at the time, but I don't snapchat or use other messengers besides iMessage. So not having watched the whole thing, I was a bit underwhelmed. Nevertheless, <!--more-->a lot of tweets this week showed how many exciting new API there are to explore and I am really looking forward to do so.

I picked up a copy of Paul Hudsons [Beyond Code](https://gum.co/beyondcode) to get up to speed with `git` and terminal and will have to rebase all the WWDC tweets for linear reading... Pauls books are definitely worth reading. At the moment, they complement my level of experience just right.

Once more, I'll have to praise the fine folks at [Git-Tower](https://git-tower.com) for their generous give-aways. I won a copy of [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) when I took part in their 2021 Mac Developer Survery.

What continues to amaze me, is their outstanding support. The coupon code for my license didn't work. I would have expected to see a freebie issue getting low priority from support, but no, they fixed it real quick.

More praise for the company can be found [here]({{<ref "posts/tower3.md"\>}}). And yes, I am a satisfied paying Git-Tower user.

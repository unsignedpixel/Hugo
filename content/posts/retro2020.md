Looking back at 2020, it wasn't as bad for me as a lot of people perceived it to be. I'll be releasing a complete rewrite of [Yafra](https://unsignedpixel.com/yafra) in 2021. It will be based on SwiftUI and the architecture of the prototype already looks much better that the previous version. But the actual UI is a bit of a challenge, because the declarative syntax of SwiftUI differs a lot from UIKit. As a result, I am still struggling with the layout of some views.

This site was long due for an overhaul, but now I am forced to actually to it, because the old version of [hugo](http://gohugo.io) used to generate these pages segfaults on my new M1 MacBook. More on that next year...

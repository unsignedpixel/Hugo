2019 started with some intense weeks of iOS development and finally the release of Yafra to the App Store in April. Fortunately, there were no serious bugs, just some minor optical glitches. Although I have plans for more features like reverse geocoding for the location data, adding previews, etc. it is very unlikely that they will be implemented any time soon. My day job requires more travel than before and there isn't enough time to update Yafra.

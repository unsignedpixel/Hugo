2021 started off quiet and I finally ported this site to a different [theme](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) for [hugo](gohugo.io). That took longer than expected, because I had to change crossreferences in some old posts and also had to update links in different places. Hugo seemed less reliable than before when updating things on the fly. I sometimes had to kill and restart hugo and refresh my browser manually to actually see the changes.
If you are interested in other quirks, I found [hugo is probably not for you](https://yawpitchroll.com/posts/hugo-probably-is-not-for-you/) an excellent and entertaining piece on hugo.

Nevertheless, I will stick with hugo and perhaps sometime tackle a theme of my own. Boxes to tick would be:
* no Javascript
* no tracking/external dependencies (like google or font delivery via CDN)
* nice typography
* support for fotos grouped by album

But I don't want to get [sidetracked]({{< ref "sidetracked" >}}) again and will rather write about things I am learning while porting [Yafra](https://unsignedpixel.com/yafra) to SwiftUI

Looking back at 2016, this certainly wasn’t the year it should have been. And no, this does not refer to Brexit/Trump or Bowie/Prince/Cohen. It is the software that did not get finished... <!--more-->

...although I had more than enough time to code it. Learning a new language like `Swift` is one thing, but getting to know all the required frameworks (especially the `NSURLSession` family of APIs) is another story. Having lofty goals does not help either. The short term goal for 2017 is to get a simple version of the software actually *done*. The definition of done excludes UI polish, ambitious but difficult to implement/test code under the hood and any ventures into new libraries or coding styles that I am not familiar with. I probably had too much time at my hands and started to procrastinate instead of diving straight in and finishing things. Another lesson learned and I will fire up Xcode now…

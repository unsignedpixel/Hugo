# Yafra-Tagger

When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Whatever can be captured in words can be conquered with understanding. Form follows fucking function. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Don’t get hung up on things that don’t fucking work. Be fucking bold. Greatness isn’t the height of your stature, it’s the heft of your spirit. Creativity requires fucking tenacity. Most of your accomplishments will be demonstrations of tenacity, not talent. You are not your fucking work. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? The details are not the details. They make the fucking design.

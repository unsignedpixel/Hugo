You love shooting film? Let YAFRA be your digital notebook for recording date, location and exposure details for every picture captured. Select your camera, load a film and then log all the data with a single tap. Switch seamlessly between different cameras. Browse exposed rolls and view a map{{<super>}}2.0{{</super>}}of the exposure location in the app or export the data to augment your scanned pictures.

### Getting started

Getting started ist easy. Yafra comes with both default cameras and default films preconfigured. But, like with any real analog film camera, you have to load a film before you can begin.
Tap the camera icon on the upper right to select a camera and a film type. Now you are good to go. Happy shooting!

### FAQ

__Can I add a short note to a film roll?__

Yes, go to the film list, tap the film and tap 'edit' to add a description.

__How can I export my log data?__

Select the film you want to export and tap the share button. Export to any app on your device or an Apple Mac.

__The exported data looks gibberish, now what?__

The data is encoded in a format called JSON and a human should be able to read aperture and exposure times plus camera info. The location data (longitude and latitude) can be entered in any online location converter.


__Why the strange name and icon?__

I started to work on Yafra because the film roll apps that existed at the time didn't meet my requirements. 'Yet Another Film Roll App' was born. Calling an app 'yet another' didn't seem like a good idea, so now it is 'Your Analog Film Roll App'. 
And to my ears, 'Yafra' sounds similar to 'Jaffa', an orange variety used in my childhood to market, well, oranges.

### Roadmap

- Add a widget
- Add export to XMP Sidecar
- Add support for describing lenses for cameras
- Add/edit infos for single frames within a film

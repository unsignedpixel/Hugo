I couldn't watch all of the WWDC 2016 keynote and caught only the last bits of macOS Sierra and a some iMessage stuff. The latter I couldn't really make sense of at the time, but I don't snap chat or use other messengers. Nevertheless, a lot of tweets this week showed how many exiting new API there'll be to explore.

I picked up a copy of Paul Hudsons [Beyond Code]("hackingwithswift.com/???") to get up to speed with `git` and terminal and will have to rebase all the WWDC tweets for linear reading... Pauls books are definitely worth reading

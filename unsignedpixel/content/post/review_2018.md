In terms of iOS development, 2018 started slowly. At the beginning of the year, I spent almost 6 weeks in New Zealand, then changed my job within the company and I had (and still have) lots of new things to learn.

But, as already mentioned in [this post]({{<ref "post/liberating_constraints.md"\>}}), constraints can boost productivity and creativity. I learned a lot on the way to getting my film roll app finished and I look forward to submitting it to the App Store early next year.

In October, I went to the Hamburg Cocoa Heads meetup for the first time. It was quite an event, because Paul Hudson (aka @twostraws) held two inspiring talks that night and the overall atmosphere was very nice.

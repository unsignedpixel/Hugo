Automating the [infrastructure]({{< ref "post/bootstrapping.md">}}) has been assigned a lower priority once more, because I want to get some serious work on an iOS project done. <!--more--> The code name for that project is _PodcastConnection_. _PodcastConnection_ will make featured (photography) podcasts more accessible for people that have no idea what a podcast, a podcatcher or even 
Apple's [Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8) app is. So why is this post titled 'slow progress'? Coding algorithms or data structures  is quite easy in Swift, but getting to grips with idomatic Cocoa and how to wire together Views and Controllers has been a bit of a struggle for me. But tonight, I could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it was neither a freight train nor a Pokemon Go player with a flashlight. 

[Update: I intend to open source _PodcastConnection_ (it is not rocket science anyway), but being the perfectionist I am, I'll keep it in a private [Bitbucket](https://Bitbucket.org) repo until I am at least half way satisfied with the code]

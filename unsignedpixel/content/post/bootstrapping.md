After dabbling around for a while with [hugo](http://gohugo.io), I decided to establish a real blogging workflow with that static site generator. And why not blog about, too?

The rough idea is that I'll script site generation first, put the site sources under version control and set up a Jenkins job to publish to my actual site.
One could argue that putting the whole thing up on Github would be much easier, but I have to expand my knowledge on CI anyway and this should be a fun project to do so.

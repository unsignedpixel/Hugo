![release](/blog/images/release.jpg)
This post should be named 1.0(Build 6) because that was the [Yafra](https://unsignedpixel.com/yafra) build I actually released to the App Store. 

<!--more-->

iOS 12.2 was out the same week, so I decided to require that version in order to benefit from the included Swift runtime. The download weights just 1.2MB. 
Backward compatibility with previous beta builds wasn't a concern either, so I changed some aspects of the JSON encoding as well and was quite happy when I pressed the "release" button. But for some reason, most of the screenshots were missing, so the App Store entry looked rather meh.

I created a new version 1.0.1 that fixes a minor bug and added the missing screenshots plus the app preview video. A tedious process, even when automating it via fastlane.

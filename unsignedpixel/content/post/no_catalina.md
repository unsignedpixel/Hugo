I missed most of the WWDC exitement because there was an internal developer conference at the same time at my company. And since I only have one (aging) iMac that needs to run several 32-bit apps, no Catalina for me and I wonÂ´t be able to join all the SwiftUI fun right now. On the upside, this should give me more time to refine Yafra.

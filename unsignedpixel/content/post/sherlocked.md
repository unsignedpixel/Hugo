The small project that has been in the works for some time sports a dark background. I should finish it in time before Apple is releasing an iOS version that supports dark mode. The corresponding `UIUserInterfaceStyle.dark` indicates that we will see something like dark mode in iOS 12. Of course, I can't claim to have invented dark mode, but I always wanted to use "sherlocked" in a blog postâ€¦

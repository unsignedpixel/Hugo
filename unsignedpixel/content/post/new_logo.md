![new logo][image-1]
This  has been in stealth mode ever since I started it way back in [2015]({{\< ref  "post/welcome-to-unsignedpixel.md" \>}}) . That means <!--more-->

 that I never promoted [unsigned pixel.com][1] on social media or elsewhere and didn't tell people about it. Up to now, it was probably a write-only-site no one ever read. 
What held me back? Lack of content is one thing. I feel that I don't post enough and the few things that get posted do not have the depth I wish they'd have. 

Plus I didn't like the previous logo ![logo][image-2] for this site. My own visual design skills are limited, so I asked my father for an idea. He came up with the new logo that I really like. :-)

Installed the public beta of macOS Sierra the other day and it breaks [XLD](http://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html). <!--more--> I should have checked [RoaringApps](https://roaringapps.com) before, but didn't. So XLD is broken, I bought some ALAC encoded files via [qobuz](http://www.qobuz.com) and can't transfer them to the old streamer that only plays FLAC files. [ffmpeg.org](http://ffmpeg.org) to the rescue, but this is a command line tool and I had to figure out how to loop over a bunch of files in a given directory with a bash script. Not a big deal, but automation is always a good thing and I learned something useful along the way.

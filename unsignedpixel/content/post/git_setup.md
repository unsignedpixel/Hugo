I only have working knowledge of subversion, but need to get up too speed with Git anyway, so I had to find a good resource to get into using Git quickly. The [git book](https://git-scm.com/book) is very thorough, but too long for a quick start, so I opted for [Learn Version Control with Git](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook)
